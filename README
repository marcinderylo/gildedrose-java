My take on the Gilded Rose kata (https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose), implemented in Java.

In addition to the initial kata code I have included a suite of tests for currently implemented features. These were
created prior to any attempt to refactor this plate of spaghetti code (never touch legacy code without coverage!).

Master branch contains the spaghetti code. My implementations will use separate branches.
